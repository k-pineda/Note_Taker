Whether you need to jot down quick thoughts, create to-do lists, or keep track of important information, this application has you covered. With user-friendly features for adding, viewing, and deleting notes, you can streamline your note-taking process like never before.The motivation behind building this project was to create a practical application that helps all kinds of people stay organized and manage their notes.      While completing this project, I learned how to use Express.js to create a back end for a web application. I also gained experience in handling HTTP requests methods such as, GET, POST and DELETE, as well as the experience of deploying an application to Heroku.
